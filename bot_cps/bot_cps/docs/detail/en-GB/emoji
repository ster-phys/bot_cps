The command to add emojis for hero icons.
Only the server owner can add them.```
/emoji
```displays buttons with emoji. By pressing the button, the emoji can be added.

※ Because there is a limit to the number of emojis that can be added to the server, you may not be able to add all hero emojis.
※ The bot must have "Manage Emojis and Stickers" permission in order to add emoji.
※ Nitro users can use emojis anywhere when they join the support server.
