A command that outputs the details of cards by entering their names (or abbreviations) in #compass.
The data is provided by [Yagi Simu](http://yagitools.html.xdomain.jp/compas-deck/).

The `cards` argument must be the names of the cards, separated by spaces.
If there is a single card name, its details are displayed; if there are multiple cards (up to four), the parameters of the deck are displayed.

The `level` argument can be used to set the levels of the cards.
The levels of the cards can also be changed by pressing the buttons that are displayed with the output.
In particular, if several cards are entered and the parameters of the deck are displayed, the following button will appear.

`[＜]`: Moves to the left.
`[−]`: Decreases the level of the currently selected card by 10.
`[＋]`: Raises the level of the currently selected card by 10.
`[＞]`: Moves to the right.

The currently selected card is marked by a filled-in square in the lower right corner (□: not selected, ■: selected).
