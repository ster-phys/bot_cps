## For Developers and Users

The first commit was made on Tue Nov 17 2020 18:45:20 GMT+0900.
Over the next two years, 958 commits were made and `bot_cps` repository evolved.

The history of its development should be kept intact, but it contains many unnecessary commits, inaccurate commit messages, etc., which make it a useless commit.
Therefore, I decided to keep only the first commit, which records the beginning of `bot_cps`, and force the other commits to be overwritten to make the git repository lighter and to clarify its history.

Although the number of commits are few, it would be nice to bear in mind that the program as it exists today is the result of a great deal of effort :)
